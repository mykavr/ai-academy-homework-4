how you can leverage those products so you can do your daily work. Not necessarily limited to work,
but you can also use that in your own private life. Then we will also discuss a bit about the pros, cons,
and limitations.
So today's session, the first part—the practitioner part—is mostly an overview of the current products
that we have available so we can have the benefits of this new paradigm which is called RAG.
Recap: What is RAG?
Lecturer: First things first: a quick recap. In case you missed the previous sessions, or in case maybe
something was not clear, just to provide a different perspective. I have two or three slides on what RAG
is.
Basically, RAG is just another software system that helps us crawl to some knowledge bases. How does
it work? It basically starts with an initial prompt. Imagine we are asking a question. Traditionally, what
we do with those questions is go to our database, find some data there, and then return an answer to
that question. But more traditionally, the questions were addressed in a formal language, which we call,
for instance, APIs, and those APIs have very clear specifications.
The difference in the paradigm of GenAI is that we can address these prompts—these questions—in
natural language, so in our mother tongue. But not only that; we don't only go and retrieve something
from the knowledge base which is relevant to our question. More than that, we are initially augmenting
that prompt—we are expanding it a bit—with some knowledge which is private. Usually, it's private; it's
related to our organization or to our private life.
Then we go with that question to a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM analyzes our question
together with the data that we retrieved here from the knowledge source and returns us an answer.
Because the magic—the power of LLMs today—is that they can answer in our mother tongue as well.
So we don't need that much formal, strict formats of questions or answers. We don't need necessarily
to pass specific arguments to questions or APIs. We don't need necessarily to use JSON files and then
retrieve a specific XML format which is further processed by another application. We don't need any of
this. We just need our language to address the question to find something that's relevant there and

Transcription: Productized & Enterprise RAG
Source Video: 1st Part_Productized Enterprise RAG (1).mp4 Speaker: Lucian Gruia (Data Science
Principal Lead, Ciklum) Date: October 2025 (as per slide context)
Introduction & Logistics
Lecturer: Welcome. To prepare the homeworks we are assigning here on these two chapters, of
course, we needed to have some sessions before that about Large Language Models, about neural
networks, and about GenAI introductions in general and fundamentals. So we can at least have the
same terminology, start understanding the paradigm, and get more familiar with the new concepts.
Today's session will be split into two parts. The first one is about "Productized and Enterprise RAG."
Actually, we are mostly reviewing what the RAG platforms are and what are the available products that
you can use. I will also do a quick recap on what RAG actually is.
The second part of the session will be on the Architecture and Design Patterns. So after about 40
minutes—we will see at the end of the first deck—you can switch. Some of you can drop; otherwise, if
you are interested, you can still stay. But I just wanted to let you know that the second part of the
session will be mostly focused on the engineering aspects. We are discussing coding and architecture
parts. If you are interested, of course, feel free to stay; otherwise, feel free to drop.
Meanwhile, my colleague Oksana is checking some settings in Zoom. I think there is a limitation where I
cannot share the entire screen, and at some point, I will need to switch from Google Slides to show you
some other screens. In case that doesn't work, it will take a while to do the switch. Maybe we can fix
that meanwhile. Oksana, feel free to interrupt me anytime in case you find any other settings there
which were not set up already.
Session Agenda
Lecturer: So, I know you had the intro session with Max on what Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) is. As I mentioned, I will do a quick recap. Then we will do a review on the existing products and
how you can leverage those products so you can do your daily work. Not necessarily limited to work,
but you can also use that in your own private life. Then we will also discuss a bit about the pros, cons,
and limitations.
So today's session, the first part—the practitioner part—is mostly an overview of the current products

[Context 3]
Host: Thank you. And the last one: Can I put RAG to my newly developed GPT and it will be very online
and up to date? Is it it?
Maksym: My newly developed GPT? Maybe person can unmute and just say few words what does it
mean like newly developed GPT?
Vasylii: Yes, so it's it's my question. So I just want to understand, do I get it right about RAGs? So if I
have some LLM, whatever, GPT or whatever, and I want I don't want to retrain it, I just want a new
information like from the new database. So it means that I can add this new shiny layer like RAG, as I
understand it's like Chroma or whatever, and it will query the data from this Chroma before into the
context window and just basically without retraining I will get all the all the information?
Maksym: Yes. Yes. Nice. Then then then it's it's fully correct. In a simple understanding... maybe I just...
[opens ChatGPT interface]. Just to show as a simple example of the RAG system as well. So when we
create some projects for example in the ChatGPT, the project files that we are adding, basically that
projects then our RAG system. Because ChatGPT just split that information to the chunks and then
utilize that that information when we are asking questions in our chat. So this is like the simple
representation of RAG system.
And you can find all of that like GPTs... until you are providing the expected like behavior or instruction,
when you just provide the the files that you wants GPTs to utilize, it will be in addition RAG system.

[Context 4]
Chunk overlap: 15% (~75 tokens).
Top-k retrieval: I would say like 3-5, sometimes 10 chunks.
Embedding dimensions: Between 768 and 1536 should be enough.
This data mainly on the research of the NVIDIA and it's kind of like golden middle data and where you
can start when you are building your RAG systems. But then within the evaluation and testing you can
find your exact the best size for the chunks and for your RAG system.
[26:35] Common Challenges
Maksym: In terms of common challenges:
Chunking and context window: As I mentioned about the problem with the chunking. If you
providing quite large chunks, then it means that that quite large chunk then you feed to the model,
so we have the problem with the additional not needed information in exact that request.
Retrieval quality: It's based on the exact system that you utilize, I mean like vector database or
approach to the data.
Latency & cost: For sure if we add to any system that we are developing some additional layer
where you need to retrieve data or make some filtering, it's coming with the cost of latency.
[27:49] Do's and Don'ts for RAG
Maksym: Some Do's and Don'ts for the RAG system:
Start simple: Quite often it's better to start from the simple approach, even from the simple base.
Start from simpler systems, not utilizing from the start the enterprise grade databases.
Evaluate: And quite important part is evaluation of your RAG pipeline. Not only like building, but
system that will help you to make the evaluation of the quality of your pipeline is quite important.
Don't rely solely on vector search: To build like more reliable system, not rely solely on the
vector search. In addition you still have like your standard searches like keyword.
Hybrid Search: We will discuss about some of the other approaches that providing much better
results when they work together as a hybrid approach and re-ranking approach as well.
Security and Access Control: One of the biggest problem within the RAG this is the security and
access control. So it's quite complex to implement this sometimes, but already some of the
systems exist and we can just utilize them.
Overload the LLM context: Working on the balance of your chunks. It shouldn't be quite big and
for sure shouldn't be quite small because based on that your user of your system will get the
result that it expected.

[Context 5]
or like bigger prompt you provided to the LLM, you are getting much worse result because LLM quite
often missing the exact like needed information in the middle. And in addition, you just providing some
noise together with that data, like some of the words or information that even not connected to your
basically use case of the communication with LLM.
[09:53] RAG Pipeline Deep Dive
Maksym: When we are going to deep dive, so in the RAG pipeline in general we have two main stages.
But when we go a bit to the details, quite often, and especially this information is missing when you
reading about the RAG pipeline, it's data preparation for that RAG pipeline. Because mainly it focus
on like the way of the chunking, what the database you can use and how you put the data. But it's
quite important to start from the preparation of your data. Because I've mentioned, for example, when
we provide huge amount of the data to the LLM, one of the big problem that together with that data
you are providing like water or noise that just can navigate LLM when it use that prompt information or
text in a wrong direction. So that's why quite often preparation of your data is quite important step as
well.
Then you have the step where you like preprocessing of the data, like making chunking process
because you cannot just put whole your 100 page document to the vector database because it will be
huge and then LLM basically will get all of that 100 page document as a prompt from the vector
database. So we have like different approaches how to split the information that coming with the
documents. And when we are talking about the documents, the information that coming as a input can
be like in many different formats. We are focusing mainly on the text formats, but it can be audio, it can
be video, it can be like images and different types like even JavaScript or Python code bases.
Then we, after the step when we split our data to the smaller pieces, we are converting that smaller
pieces to the numeric value. And then that numeric value basically ingest to the vector database.
And we have step of the Retrieval. It's when already our user of our system basically make the
request, and our system based on that request making the similarity search from the vector database.
And based on the results of that similarity search, it's choosing like top-K chunks. Normally you are

self-correction.
And when it's to use? When we have quite complex queries. And in cases if everything else
that we discussed earlier failed and you need to have more higher accuracy. When we
shouldn't use this? It's for the simple retrievals. And if our top quality attribute for our system
is latency. Because you understand that this Agentic systems, when we have LLM and need to
increase the quality of the results, the time of these types of the request is growing.
Hybrid Search & Reranking
Lecturer:
I guess we will need maybe... Oksana, I guess our time is end.
Moderator (Oksana):
Yes, we are a bit out of time. If you have time you can continue. And also colleagues, if you
have a little bit of ten minutes, we can continue this session.
Lecturer:
I will try to finish this like in five minutes and then we will have five minutes for the questions. I
just will not stop quite deeply on each of the slide, just few words and what is the information
important from that.
In addition to increase the quality of our RAG systems—and why I mentioned earlier that you
shouldn't rely only on the vector search—in addition, you can utilize best match search. This is
what BM25. It doesn't have semantic understanding, but it calculates the number of words
that it finds—like the same words that it find in the different documents—and can provide,
based on that statistical calculation, what the documents we should pick up. And on the
researches, when we have Hybrid System approach in terms of the search (Vector + this
BM25), it increase accuracy for a bit more than 10 percentage. NDCG@3, this is like top three
recalls basically. Top three candidates that we saw earlier on the diagram.
And when we add the Reranker in addition, it's even increased to 37.2 percentage. Reranking,
it's additional layer that we adding to the system. And we are grabbing from our vector
system, or from our database, a bit more results. So we are grabbing instead of 5/10
candidates, we are grabbing 100 candidates. And then our reranking system try to understand
what is the best candidates for us and then provide as a result to the LLM like 5 or 10 or
maybe 3 of them.
Production Readiness: Do's and Don'ts
Lecturer:

[Context 2]
And we have step of the Retrieval. It's when already our user of our system basically make the
request, and our system based on that request making the similarity search from the vector database.
And based on the results of that similarity search, it's choosing like top-K chunks. Normally you are
setting that it's between like 5 to 10 top results that you are grabbing from that vector database. And
then LLM decide what part of the information from that chunk it should pick up to fulfill the intent of
the request of the user and provide the output.
[13:46] Chunking Strategies
Maksym: So chunking and approach to the chunking is quite important part of this all of the RAG
system. Because context window of the LLMs it's limited for most of the LLMs. Right now for sure we
have quite huge one even within the last Gemini versions, they mentioning that the context window can
grow up to 2 million tokens. But still the problem with missing information in the middle still persist with
huge context that you are providing to the model. Even right now the situation is improving and mainly
labs working quite heavily to improve the retrieval and finding and processing of the whole of the
information that you providing to the LLM. But still this is the problem of reliability so to say.
And within the chunks, you have like challenges to get the proper balance. And if you split your
document in a too large pieces, then you will have as a result like not the best retrieval or a lot of the
noise or water that you are providing as a part of the request. Or if you putting it's too small, then you
are losing basically the main context of that information because it can be splitted in a different parts.
And it can be the case that based on the similarity search you will not get the full context of the
information and LLM can provide not reliable response.
Three Main Chunking Strategies:
1. Fixed-Size: This is when we split our information basically in a fixed size, like for example 512
tokens. And we are having like overlap, and overlap basically help us to potentially preserve some
context from the previous chunk. It help us to increase the potential quality of the chunks that we
will have. It is the simplest approach. It has cons, for example, if you always have a standard size,
it can be the case that your chunk will break in a mid of the sentence or will not have still the main

[Context 3]
you are not only retrieving that important chunk of data, but you are actually looking forward and
seeing: Where does that chunk come from? What's the document that comes from?
If you don't have large documents—for instance, you have some Confluence pages which are limited to
4-5 pages—searching through them might not give you relevant answers because they may have many
ideas. So that's why you need to split them by concept. But then you still need to pass the whole
context to the LLM.
Lecturer: After you do the retrieval, you may want to do Re-ranking. Re-ranking is not done with the
same mechanism that helped you retrieve from the database; it's done with another LLM. So you are
basically asking for a second opinion: "Do you think this is really relevant to my question? Yes or not?"
Or you can do Query Transformations. Instead of asking a simple question, you need to augment
your question sometimes. Imagine the scenario where you are asking about "Ciklum". "Tell me what
Ciklum does." And then after that, you come back with another question and say, "Now tell me what
they do."
The LLM (or the embedding model) will ask you, "What does 'they' mean?" It will look to the vector
store and will not find anything relevant to "they". So that's why you need sometimes to transform your
query. Every time you are asking the question, you go and augment your question by looking through
the history. You understand that "they" is actually talking about "Ciklum".
[13:25] Code Walkthrough and Architecture
[Lecturer switches to IDE view]
Lecturer: So, we have the API section here. The API part is basically how I am building the REST
endpoints. We have chat , we have chunk data, we have add-to-qdrant (this is how we index and
add to the vector store), and search-qdrant .
Then we have the config file ( config.yaml ), which has multiple parameters. I built this in a way that
we can play with multiple stuff here, such as:
Enabling/Disabling history management.
Changing the size of the history.
Chunking Configuration: We have enable_variable: false and enable_semantic: true . We

[Context 4]
Character Recognition). So basically the ML system or it can be LLM that can look exactly on
the PDF and then provide in the text view describe what it sees on the PDF. And then we can
just vectorize it quite easily.
Still we have issue with the tables quite often. And here like some OCR, again, can help, some
other approaches, captions. So instead of using complex retrieval system and that relying on
OCR—because they quite often failing with that—we can just use some embedding model
that can understand what it see. So just embed the image.
And one of the interesting approach to solve this question for the last time, it's quite new, let's
say approach, it's ColPali library changes. So they, instead of using OCR just for the
describing what information exist on the PDF and then vectorize that information, they have
Vision Language Model for that. And image representation just split to the patches, and then
that patches basically embed to the model. And when we have the retrieval, then we utilize
that embedding model and still vision language model to give the answer what we have from
that images. And this approach shows much better results in terms of RAG system retrieval of
the information from the system. And it showed better result like 15 percentage approximately
than standard retrieval system with the OCR that we have.
So to answer on the question: quite often when we utilize the PDFs, when we have a PDFs as a
documents, we utilize the OCR for describing of that documents and then we store the
information. But this approach with the ColPali showing quite interesting results and maybe
it's something that will be used much more often in the future as a part of this type of RAG
systems. But still mostly OCR approach used.
Agentic RAG
Lecturer:
And a bit about Agentic RAG. Because in AI right now everything changed to the Agentic RAG.
And for sure this is quite interesting and quite reliable approach. So in the standard RAG we
have query, and that query going to the embedding model, then we query the embedding
vector databases, then vector databases provide to us candidates—like top candidates—and
then our query (so our request) plus candidates that our vector database provided goes to
the LLM. LLM then process all of that information that we put and then provide to our user the
answer.

RAG Intro Lecture Transcript
Date: October 2025
Topic: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Speaker: Maksym Lypivskyi (Head of Cloud Platforms & AI Director, Ciklum)
[00:00] Introduction
Host: And as we are starting with the RAG topic, today we will have a small intro and then move on to
the databases for GenAI. Our speaker for today's session is Maksym, and we will start with the intro as I
said. Maksym, you are very welcome to start.
[00:18] Lecture Start
Maksym: Hello. Very happy to see you all today. I will start from organizational topics as well. It
depends on how fast we will move; potentially we will have some small break between sessions, but
let's see.
So, today mainly we will focus exactly on the way how LLMs can utilize external information for
providing value to the users that basically utilize some systems. And we will focus on RAG from a
different perspective. First hour focus and first hour presentation will be around general RAG: why do
we need RAG, and some more practical details that potentially will help you to navigate in this huge and
complex world where you can find a lot of the tools for different purposes, a lot of the databases, but
you don't know where to start and maybe where and how to progress.
[01:43] Speaker Introduction
Maksym: So let's start maybe a bit from the introduction. So I'm Max. Right now at Ciklum, I'm Global
Head of Cloud Platforms and AI Director. So I'm already nine years within Ciklum. Long time ago I came
here as a middle JavaScript engineer and went through the different stages of promotions, and I was
so lucky to have experience with different SDLC processes and stages. That's why right now I can jump
much deeper not only into engineering topics, into DevOps topics, Cloud topics, and in product topics
as well.
So from the start of the ChatGPT era, I jumped to the AI direction as a self-learner, and I was amazed
with the sum of the experience that I got within the LLM. And right now my main interest is to make AI
systems as much reliable as it's possible. That's why maybe you can find some of the topics that I did
from the previous academies around prompt engineering. This is where I started to adopting LLM and
tried to make them more reliable.

self-correction.
And when it's to use? When we have quite complex queries. And in cases if everything else
that we discussed earlier failed and you need to have more higher accuracy. When we
shouldn't use this? It's for the simple retrievals. And if our top quality attribute for our system
is latency. Because you understand that this Agentic systems, when we have LLM and need to
increase the quality of the results, the time of these types of the request is growing.
Hybrid Search & Reranking
Lecturer:
I guess we will need maybe... Oksana, I guess our time is end.
Moderator (Oksana):
Yes, we are a bit out of time. If you have time you can continue. And also colleagues, if you
have a little bit of ten minutes, we can continue this session.
Lecturer:
I will try to finish this like in five minutes and then we will have five minutes for the questions. I
just will not stop quite deeply on each of the slide, just few words and what is the information
important from that.
In addition to increase the quality of our RAG systems—and why I mentioned earlier that you
shouldn't rely only on the vector search—in addition, you can utilize best match search. This is
what BM25. It doesn't have semantic understanding, but it calculates the number of words
that it finds—like the same words that it find in the different documents—and can provide,
based on that statistical calculation, what the documents we should pick up. And on the
researches, when we have Hybrid System approach in terms of the search (Vector + this
BM25), it increase accuracy for a bit more than 10 percentage. NDCG@3, this is like top three
recalls basically. Top three candidates that we saw earlier on the diagram.
And when we add the Reranker in addition, it's even increased to 37.2 percentage. Reranking,
it's additional layer that we adding to the system. And we are grabbing from our vector
system, or from our database, a bit more results. So we are grabbing instead of 5/10
candidates, we are grabbing 100 candidates. And then our reranking system try to understand
what is the best candidates for us and then provide as a result to the LLM like 5 or 10 or
maybe 3 of them.

[Context 3]
that "close and far," it's basically like vector databases when we set up like "choose top five
results," providing to us with the answer from the five closest objects and then retransform
this to the text. And we are basically getting that text that is most closest to the text from our
request. In this case, like for the "machine learning," "ML algorithms" is quite close because
the distance is 0.02. And if we just want to get only one top element, then we are getting "ML
algorithms." "Pizza recipes" is quite far, so most probably the system will not suggest this to
us.
How Similarity Search Works
Lecturer:
And if we are going a bit deeper to the exact similarity search, how it works: So we have our
documents—we already discussed about the RAG pipeline—so it's already transformed to the
numerical representation from the embedding models, and it's stored somewhere here to the
vector store. And we have three documents, and we fully indexed those documents, and it's
stored.
And when we have a search, and if we have a user query like "learn Python," then based on
that documents that we stored, our system identifies the distance for our request. And in this
case: "quite close," "somewhat close," and "far away." If we set up that we want to pick up two
top results, so in this case, we will get "Python tutorial" and "Java programming" as well. And
then LLM maybe make a decision to show only "Python tutorial." But it can be the case that it
will provide as an output to the user both "Python tutorial" and "Java programming" because
the quality of the LLM plays quite a significant role in this case as well.
Quite often, similarity metrics that systems identify, this is: angle between the vectors, straight
line (just distance between them), and in some cases, some dot multiplication in that systems.
Embedding Quality Matters
Lecturer:
So, why does embedding quality matter? Because basically, it means how reliable the answer
our user of our system will get. And right now, MTEB metrics—to be honest, I don't remember
exactly this full abbreviation, but I provided the link to the leaderboard and you will see what
exactly it means—this is the approach how currently embedding models are evaluated on the

[Context 4]
are moving to improving all of these tools and systems: the previous result was more than 200
seconds. So the order of magnitude in terms of the speed increase for the vectorization is in
10 times. So that system is much more improved. And we are going on that speed, and that
changes with many models, systems, and tools in AI world because people experimenting,
companies pouring a lot of effort in this race, so to say.
Databases for Vectorization
Lecturer:
And if we will talk a bit more about the databases exactly for the vectorization... This is where I
wanted to mention about the speed of changes as well. Because earlier I had this slide "Why
we need to have separate database for embeddings" and that current databases systems,
they have different algorithms, they don't have everything that is needed for the embeddings,
they are quite slow for the embeddings. But Postgres is moving with their extension quite
rapidly and catching up the speed question and especially amount of the
operations—basically queries per second—that they can handle. And a lot of the researches
already show that Postgres is quite a good alternative to the specialized, even, databases for
the RAG.
So you can see that, for example, faster than Pinecone, and for sure cheaper, and still open
source. And for Qdrant, it can handle much more requests per second, but it's on a huge
amount of the data. So they tested this on the 50 million embeddings. And this is where
Qdrant starts degrading with the speed of working. So, potentially you can use just that
database that you used to, and you just need to add additional extension for the embeddings
and you can continue playing with your lovely Postgres.
But still, we have the databases for the vectorization and they still play their own game. And
for what systems they have the best results? And it was already mentioned about Chroma
today. And Chroma is quite good when you are starting some of the prototyping. It's less rare
used in some big production systems, but they already have their Cloud Chroma—I didn't
try—and still they have some kind of limitations. So Chroma database quite good when you
are starting and prototyping because it's quite easy to start. You just pip install Chroma and
almost everything is working. So minimal configuration and you are starting almost

[Context 5]
you are not only retrieving that important chunk of data, but you are actually looking forward and
seeing: Where does that chunk come from? What's the document that comes from?
If you don't have large documents—for instance, you have some Confluence pages which are limited to
4-5 pages—searching through them might not give you relevant answers because they may have many
ideas. So that's why you need to split them by concept. But then you still need to pass the whole
context to the LLM.
Lecturer: After you do the retrieval, you may want to do Re-ranking. Re-ranking is not done with the
same mechanism that helped you retrieve from the database; it's done with another LLM. So you are
basically asking for a second opinion: "Do you think this is really relevant to my question? Yes or not?"
Or you can do Query Transformations. Instead of asking a simple question, you need to augment
your question sometimes. Imagine the scenario where you are asking about "Ciklum". "Tell me what
Ciklum does." And then after that, you come back with another question and say, "Now tell me what
they do."
The LLM (or the embedding model) will ask you, "What does 'they' mean?" It will look to the vector
store and will not find anything relevant to "they". So that's why you need sometimes to transform your
query. Every time you are asking the question, you go and augment your question by looking through
the history. You understand that "they" is actually talking about "Ciklum".

Chunk overlap: 15% (~75 tokens).
Top-k retrieval: I would say like 3-5, sometimes 10 chunks.
Embedding dimensions: Between 768 and 1536 should be enough.
This data mainly on the research of the NVIDIA and it's kind of like golden middle data and where you
can start when you are building your RAG systems. But then within the evaluation and testing you can
find your exact the best size for the chunks and for your RAG system.
[26:35] Common Challenges
Maksym: In terms of common challenges:
Chunking and context window: As I mentioned about the problem with the chunking. If you
providing quite large chunks, then it means that that quite large chunk then you feed to the model,
so we have the problem with the additional not needed information in exact that request.
Retrieval quality: It's based on the exact system that you utilize, I mean like vector database or
approach to the data.
Latency & cost: For sure if we add to any system that we are developing some additional layer
where you need to retrieve data or make some filtering, it's coming with the cost of latency.
[27:49] Do's and Don'ts for RAG
Maksym: Some Do's and Don'ts for the RAG system:
Start simple: Quite often it's better to start from the simple approach, even from the simple base.
Start from simpler systems, not utilizing from the start the enterprise grade databases.
Evaluate: And quite important part is evaluation of your RAG pipeline. Not only like building, but
system that will help you to make the evaluation of the quality of your pipeline is quite important.
Don't rely solely on vector search: To build like more reliable system, not rely solely on the
vector search. In addition you still have like your standard searches like keyword.
Hybrid Search: We will discuss about some of the other approaches that providing much better
results when they work together as a hybrid approach and re-ranking approach as well.
Security and Access Control: One of the biggest problem within the RAG this is the security and
access control. So it's quite complex to implement this sometimes, but already some of the
systems exist and we can just utilize them.
Overload the LLM context: Working on the balance of your chunks. It shouldn't be quite big and
for sure shouldn't be quite small because based on that your user of your system will get the
result that it expected.

[Context 4]
from the simplest one just for the rapid start, and when your system is growing, you are
moving to the, let's say, next one. And each of them just fulfill their purpose.
Advanced RAG Patterns
Lecturer:
And about RAG patterns in addition to the embeddings... because we discussed about the
embeddings, vectorization... It's not only one pattern or approach for the RAG systems. In
addition, we can have this problem with the Multi-Hop Reasoning with the connection. And in
cases where we have a bit more vague request and we need to identify the connection for
that request, in most cases traditional vector RAG systems, they are failing. And in the
example that I provided, the problem that we need to have connection built from our request
that user asked: "Marketing, budget, compliance, GDPR," and basically "Europe." And this is
the connections. And this is exactly when we need already to utilize graph system and
GraphRAG in addition. And it helps to increase reliability of our system together with LLM.
And quite often this is representation of the graph that we have. And when our user making
the request, it's just getting some of the information from the request and learning the
different connections. And based on the connection that we have in the RAG representation, it
can provide much better answer if we do not have explicit information and one chunk of the
information that we are grabbing from our vector system is not enough.
Main players for the GraphRAG solutions: So Neo4j, Falkor, TigerGraph, Memgraph, and
ArangoDB. Mainly we are playing with the Neo4j because you can easily install it on your
laptop, and I guess it's one of the most popular solutions I would say.
The PDF Processing Problem
Lecturer:
The next problem that quite often coming: the PDF processing problem. So in a PDF, we can
have images, in a PDF we can have tables and maybe some formulas. So it's quite complex
documents to parse for the LLM. And in a traditional RAG pipelines, we have OCR (Optical
Character Recognition). So basically the ML system or it can be LLM that can look exactly on
the PDF and then provide in the text view describe what it sees on the PDF. And then we can
just vectorize it quite easily.
Still we have issue with the tables quite often. And here like some OCR, again, can help, some

how you can leverage those products so you can do your daily work. Not necessarily limited to work,
but you can also use that in your own private life. Then we will also discuss a bit about the pros, cons,
and limitations.
So today's session, the first part—the practitioner part—is mostly an overview of the current products
that we have available so we can have the benefits of this new paradigm which is called RAG.
Recap: What is RAG?
Lecturer: First things first: a quick recap. In case you missed the previous sessions, or in case maybe
something was not clear, just to provide a different perspective. I have two or three slides on what RAG
is.
Basically, RAG is just another software system that helps us crawl to some knowledge bases. How does
it work? It basically starts with an initial prompt. Imagine we are asking a question. Traditionally, what
we do with those questions is go to our database, find some data there, and then return an answer to
that question. But more traditionally, the questions were addressed in a formal language, which we call,
for instance, APIs, and those APIs have very clear specifications.
The difference in the paradigm of GenAI is that we can address these prompts—these questions—in
natural language, so in our mother tongue. But not only that; we don't only go and retrieve something
from the knowledge base which is relevant to our question. More than that, we are initially augmenting
that prompt—we are expanding it a bit—with some knowledge which is private. Usually, it's private; it's
related to our organization or to our private life.
Then we go with that question to a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM analyzes our question
together with the data that we retrieved here from the knowledge source and returns us an answer.
Because the magic—the power of LLMs today—is that they can answer in our mother tongue as well.
So we don't need that much formal, strict formats of questions or answers. We don't need necessarily
to pass specific arguments to questions or APIs. We don't need necessarily to use JSON files and then
